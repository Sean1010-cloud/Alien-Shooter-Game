# Alien-Shooter
A remake of a typical alien shooter game where the player fires projectiles at enemy ships. This project was built for an assignment, but allowed me to learn a lot. The entire project was made using Java.


# Features 
- Control the player ship: You can move up, down, left, and right without exiting the screen.
- Press the spacebar to shoot missiles upwards towards spawning enemy ships.
- Earn points when an enemy ship is successfully destroyed
- Lose a life if an enemy ship collides with your ship (from total of 3 lives)
